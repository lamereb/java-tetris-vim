## Tetris in Java - now with vim controls

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lamereb/java-tetris-vim/master/tetris.png)

A simple implementation of Tetris written in Java, no game libraries or anything, just AWT & Swing.

Some of the code is ugly, especially w/r/t rotating pieces, but hey, it works. Hardest part of debugging Tetris, though, is to stopping yourself from playing Tetris.

To compile:
`javac TetrisFrame.java`

To run:
`java TetrisFrame`

Or just `make.sh` to compile and run (a Java make shell script haha).
